                <p>Signalis is set in a time where space travel exists.</p>
                <p>In this world gestalts also exist, which is a fancy term for androids.</p>
                <p>You play as Elster, an LSTR unit (haha funny), on a self-imposed quest to find a girl in photo.</p>

                    <p>That's about it, the rest is completely incomprehensible</p>
                    <p>It's a beautifully told story but, good luck trying to discipher any meaning behind anything that happens.</p>
                    <p>I mean just look at the quote in the middle of the screen and the art in the background.</p>
                    <p>Only thing I got, was that there was a war at some point, and bioresonants are thing.</p>
                    <p>Bioresonants being people with the ability to control the wavelength of the universe or something.</p>
                    <p>It is the most lovecraftian videogame to ever exist.</p>

                <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                <p>The gameplay is your classic Resident Evil 2 survival horror style game. With a lot of cool point and click puzzles to solve. And from a top-down perspective.</p>
                <p>The survival horror aspect is extremely apparent (if you're playing on hard or something) with the very limited resources you can collect and use.</p>
                <p>And the puzzles are just puzzles, but quite unique and harder than most games.</p>
                <p>The combat isn't that hardest in the world, but it's surprisingly easy to miss, making you line up shots for far longer than you should, since every shot counts</p>
                <p>Also enemies get back up, and you don't have a lot of resources for getting rid of their bodies, so good luck with that.</p>
